## Learnings
* Even when you know the path through the docs in order to get the Management
  API key, there is only one login you can give (email/password) to generate
  a key, and it is unclear what access is given to it. I assume it can be used
  to manage in any space you have access to, but don't know for sure.
* Contentful Go SDK is still very rough around the edges :)
* Even if it weren't, the content structure is complex enough to make it a
  challenge to generate something very simple with existing content. Too many
  additional metadata fields compared to how much content you have.
